# HiveGUI
HiveGUI is a flexible framework designed for creating simple and interactive UIs with ease. Its main advantage lies in its platform- and renderer-agnostic nature, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly with any graphics or UI backend. HiveGUI requires only a minimal set of basic primitives Rectangle, Text, and Image making it lightweight yet versatile for diverse applications. This simplicity enables developers to focus on building intuitive and responsive interfaces without needing to worry about platform-specific constraints or rendering details.
